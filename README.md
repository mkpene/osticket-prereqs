Once the installer was downloaded, I ran it and followed the installation wizard's steps. I opted for the complete installation since I wanted access to all the features. During the setup, I was prompted to set a root password, which I made sure was strong and memorable. Also went ahead and configured the settings to be amiable with OS Ticket.
